# Project layout
- `frontend/` houses the code for the React Native app. See it's [readme](./frontend/README.md) for more details.
- `backend/` houses the code for the api server. See it's [readme](./backend/README.md) for more details.
- `common/` houses types and code that are shared between the front end and backend. Currently no dependencies are allowed in `common`.
- `ci/` houses shell scripts and build definitions (currently running on [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs)). See it's [readme](./ci/README.md) for more details.

# Cloning the repo
`--recurse-submodules` will init and clone all nested submodules in the project
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Raheem-ai/patch.git
```

# Local Development

## Dependencies/Setup
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node/NPM 16.9.1+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Expo cli](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (just run the commands under "Install Corepack")
    then run 
    ```
    $> yarn set version berry
    $> yarn install
    ```
- add provided env specific credentials for certain GCP apis in `$RAHEEM_INFRA_ROOT/config/raheem-<env>-adc.json`

## Infra project
A seperate github project that is pulled in as a git submodule, the infra project is a centralized abstraction around system level resources like secrets/config that tie into technical resources like a 3rd party api key or redis cache. It simultaneously handles the creation/update of config/secrets, automating dev ops tasks around their management via a CLI, and backend services consuming them in code. Because the project is brought in as a submodule, changes to infrastructure can be deployed in lockstep with the features that depend on them.

The infra project sits in the root of the project it is embedded in. It expects a config file in the embedding projct and a designated directory outside of all projects to use as a workspace. Please read through the [Infra README](backend/infra/README.md) for setup instructions and more info.

## Spinning up dev (local) environment
As a one off step, you need to generate the dev (local) config for the backend to consume 
(You will need to re-run this whenever you add/update a secret/config in infra)
```sh
# from `backend/` 
> yarn node infra/bin/run config:generate -e dev  
```

Once you have generated `backend/env/.env.dev`, there are 5 commands that need to be run in different shells to simulate an environment locally


Start ngrok to get a public url for your local dev server
```sh
# from anywhere
$> ngrok http 9000
```

Start mock GCP PubSub instance for backend events -> ui updates
```sh
# from anywhere
$> docker run --rm -it -p 8681:8681 gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk gcloud beta emulators pubsub start --project=fake
```

Start mock redis instance (for socket.io websocket adapter to use)
```sh
# from anywhere
$> docker run --rm -it -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Start backend 
```sh
# from `backend/`
$> yarn run dev
```

Start frontend
```sh
# from `frontend/`
$> yarn install 
$> yarn run dev
``` 

## Testing locally on a phone
- spin up dev environment
- copy the https url that ngrok outputs (in the form of `https://<hash>.ngrok.io`) and change the initial value of `apiHost` in `frontend/app.config.js` (*Don't check in changes to the initialization of apiHost*)
- download [expo go app](https://expo.dev/client)
- create account?
- scan qr code produced by `$> expo start --no-https` and follow the link

## Build/Deployment

### Backend
The building of the backend image and it's deployment to staging/prod happends through GCP's CI/CD triggered by git. The definition for the backend build/deploy pipeline can be found at `backend/deployment/api.build.json`

To test building/running the container locally run 
```sh
# from `<root>/`
$> docker build -f ./api.dockerfile .  # this will produce <imageId>
$> docker run --rm -it --env-file ./backend/env/.env.dev <imageId>
```

### Frontend (TODO: tie this into the build)
The frontend is currently deployed locally via the expo cli
```sh
$> expo publish --release-channel <prod | staging>
```

# TODO: Standing up an Environment
- create redis instance
- create pubsub instance/enable the api?
- set up apikey for google tings 
    - google maps api for iOS 
    - google maps api for Android
    - google place api
    - google geocoding api 
    - [restrict google api key for ios app with the bundle identifier ai.raheem.patch.<env>](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials?)
        - also add ai.raheem.patch.dev for non-prod environments
- set up build hooks (if we wanT ci/cd on it)
- add secrets to secret store
    - expo build-deploy-bot-secret
    - infra git deploy key (write perms): 'infra-git-ssh-key'
    - patch git deploy key (write perms): 'patch-git-ssh-key'


# Dev Ops Tasks

## Creating git deploy key
1) Create the pub/priv key pair
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "what's this key for?"
```

2) [Add](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) pub key to target repo's deploy keys.

3) put prive key in the secret store so it can be securely accessed at build/deploy time 



## Setting up infra admin credentials on mongo db so we can programatically update it
1) go to cloud.mongodb.com and [create a new API Key](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/)
2) install mongocli in mongo dockerfile
```sh
# TODO: not sure how to rotate this infra level key programatically but that's okay for now

```


# Deployment Scenarios [WIP]
TLDR; can't have any breaking changes on the backend without releasing a back compat version first OR booting everyone to the newest version

NOTE: appstore webhooks don't exist to know when a new version is available in the store

NOTE: might need to lock serverside versions with the native app version they went out with 
so we never have an older app version looking at a newer serverside version, make dynamicConfig something publicly accessable so all app versions
can force upgrading if needed, and update dynamic config when we depricate older app versions
    - challenges:
        - having dynamic config accessable to all app versions while routing all other api calls to the right version specific serverside deployment

then deployed versions would look like

TERMINOLOGY: 
- Base Version: the native version of the front end that non breaking changes to either the frontend/backend 
will be applied to
- Runtime Version: the version in time that an app is using which could be N iterations of non breaking changes to
the front/backend...runtime versions are always tied to a Base Bersion

ASSUMPTIONS: any breaking backend change will be accompanied by a front end change 

NOTE: redo this with the following syntax 
F(xn) = base version x, runtime version n for the front
B(xn) = base version x, runtime version n for the back
- ... = iterations of runtime versions on a base version (concurrent backend versions running at the same time)
F(xn)' = a breaking change from the backend caused the front end to need to be redeployed
B(xn)' = a breaking change from the frontend caused the backend to need to be redeployed
<!-- X' = it had a non breaking change
'X = a breaking change from the other one caused it to need to be redeployed -->

1) Non-native frontend change
- F(a1) B(a1) -> F(a2) B(a1)

2) Native frontend change
- F(a1) B(a1)
- F(b1) B(b1)

3) Backcompat backend change
- F(a1) B(a1) -> F(a1) B(a2)

4) Breaking backend change
- F(a1) B(a1)
- F(b1) B(b1)

5) 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 1
 - F(a1) B(a1) -> F(a2) B(a1) -> F(a2) B(a2)
 - F(b1) B(b1)'
 - F(c1)' B(c1) -> F(c2)' B(c1)

<!--  -->

1) Non-native frontend change
- front(A) back(A) -> front(A') back(A)

2) Native frontend change
- front(A) back(A)
- front(B) back(B)

3) Backcompat backend change
- front(A) back(A) -> front(A) back(A')

4) Breaking backend change
- front(A) back(A)
- front(B) back(B)

NOTE: ^^^I actually think this one might be able to just deploy the new backend with the corresponding non
breaking changes to the frontend...except their would be a time period where people haven't closed and reopened the app to get the latest from the front end so someone using the frontend when we deploy could have the backend break their experience

5) 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 1
 - front(A) back(A) -> front(A') back(A) -> front(A') back(A')
 - front(B') back(B')
 - front(C') back(C') -> front(C'') back(C')

 NOTE: this means breaking backend changes cause frontend to be rebuilt

## Frontend changes (EX. changes to a string, color, etc)
    - regular deployment
        - deploy backend
        - deploy frontend
        - switch traffic to new backend 

## Breaking backend changes + frontend changes (EX. moving store to use diffs)
    - regular deployment of back compat backend version + frontend changes
    - users will automatically be updated to newest frontend when they reopen app
    - use analytics to know when everyone is using the latest version
    - remove back compat code

## Native frontend changes (EX. new ui that needed a native lib) (`dynamicConfig.appVersion.requiresUpdate == false`)
    - Create new Expo Build + upload to app stores
    - Deploy
        - Do first deployment to frontend (will be tied to new native version so no one will see it yet)
        - Do deployment of backend (exposed to everyone but not a problem since there is nothing breaking)
    - Release new versions to app stores
    - run `dynamicConfig:update` to Tell people there is a new version out so they can be prompted to update from the app store (update DynamicConfig + send event on pubsub)

## Breaking backend changes + Native Frontend changes (EX. switching to E2EE branch) (`dynamicConfig.appVersion.requiresUpdate == true`)
    - Create new Expo Build + upload to app stores
    - Deploy
        - Do first deployment to frontend (will be tied to new native version so no one will see it yet)
        - Do deployment of backend (don't switch traffic yet so old verions still work)
    - Release new versions to app stores
    - run `dynamicConfig:update` to Tell people there is a new version out that is required so they can be prompted to force update from the app store (update DynamicConfig + send event on pubsub)
    - switch traffic to service the newest version everyone has to onboard to

## Failure points
    - users on front(A) and back(A)
    - release non-breaking front(B)
        - ex. update scroll wheel input to use different native lib
        - some users on front(A) back(A)
        - some users on front(B) back(A)
    - release breaking back(B) with front(B')
        - ex. upgrade mongoose version on backend so db semantics (and thus api responses) slightly change
        - some users on front(A) back(B) [BROKEN]
        - some users on front(B') back(B)
